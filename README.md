# ICCTHealth-EconomicImpactsModel
This is an Excel VBA model that quantifies premature mortality and associated economic impacts of transport attributable fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions in India. The methodology this model uses is explained in Appendix A of the document 'ICCT_IndiaRetrospective_2013.pdf'. 

The model itself is the file 'ham_v1.5.xlsm'. There are 10 input sheets for this model. 8 of the ten input sheets have baseline data that is in the 8 .xlsx files. City-level transportation PM2.5 emissions under a business as usual (BAU) scenario and a new policy scenario are also needed. The user will have to generate these using an emissions model or obtain them elsewhere. 

This model was developed in 2012, primarily by Gaurav Bansal with support from others at the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT).
